## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I've learned about the use of mediaqueries and more about properties of Flex and how it behaves based on the max-width property or in the changes of display.

### Continued development

I believe another approach could have been taken here by using Grid, so I believe I'll try and learn more about how to use Grid after I'm comfortable working Flex.
